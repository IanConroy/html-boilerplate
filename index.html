    <h1>Hello Again, World...</h1>
    <p>
        It all begins here, and I gotta go all the way. Here I will post some creative ideas that I 
        want to do along the way...
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I don't know much so far. But
        I have an idea what I can do if I keep going. In fact, I have many ideas.
        Let's list some ideas and aspirations:
    </p>
    <br><ul>
    <li>Design something for kids, some sort of interactive character comic maybe</li>
    <li>Utilize my expository skills, expanding and growing on them as well</li>
    <li>Program for fantasy football purposes; possibly data extrapolation for takes</li>
    <li>Designing my own fantasy page</li>
    <li>Incorporate accessibility, such as for visual or hearing impaired individuals</li>
    <li>Make a page as an illustration and outlet to make the world a better place</li>
    <li>Seeing how much I can do with CSS</li>
    <li>Designing beautiful color schemes. I just love that</li>
    <li>Finally, one of my childhood dreams: making my own game</li>
    <li>Undoubtedly, many more than I'm gonna fit on this list or elsewhere</li>
<br></ul>
    <h3><em>I know I have to go through the motions.</em>But if anyone happens to see this,
    just know that this journey will have me eventually change this world in some way, however small it may be. 
    Even if this is all I have to start with right now. Thanks for reading.</h3>
