    <h1>Hello Again, World...</h1>
    <p>
        While I have been here before, and this is possibly the third or fourth time
        I've started, I know this will be the time I go all the way. Sometimes it's just a 
        feeling. But when the feeling is best described as undying, limitless passion and an
        outlet for a ton of creative ideas that I could easily get into because I genuinely
        WANT to...
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I think it's clear that this is where I want to be. I don't know much so far. But
        I have an idea what I can do if I keep going. In fact, I have many ideas.
        Let's list some ideas and aspirations:
    </p>
    <br>
    <ul>Design the most beautiful pages anyone ever saw</ul>
    <ul>Design something for kids, some sort of interactive character comic maybe</ul>
    <ul>Utilize my expository skills, expanding and growing on them as well</ul>
    <ul>Program for fantasy purposes; possibly data extrapolation for takes</ul>
    <ul>Designing my own fantasy page</ul>
    <ul>Incorporate accessibility, such as for visually or hearing impaired</ul>
    <ul>Make a page as an illustration and outlet to make the world a better place</ul>
    <ul>Seeing how much I can do with CSS</ul>
    <ul>Designing beautiful color schemes. I just love that</ul>
    <ul>Finally, one of my childhood dreams: making my own game</ul>
    <ul>Undoubtedly, many, many more than I'm gonna fit on this list currently</ul>
<br>
    <h3><em>I know I have to go through the motions.</em>But if anyone happens to see this,
    just know that this journey will have me eventually change this world. 
    Even if this is all I have to start with right now. Thanks for reading.</h3>
