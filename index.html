    <h1>Hello Again, World...</h1>
    <p>
        While I have been here before, and this is possibly the third or fourth time
        I've started, I know this will be the time I go all the way. Sometimes it's just a 
        feeling. But when the feeling is best described as undying, limitless passion and an
        outlet for a ton of creative ideas that I could easily get into because I genuinely
        WANT to...
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I think it's clear that this is where I want to be. I don't know much so far. But
        I have an idea what I can do if I keep going. In fact, I have many ideas.
        Let's list some ideas and aspirations:
    </p>
    <ol>Design the most beautiful pages anyone ever saw</ol>
    <ol>Design something for kids, some sort of interactive character comic maybe</ol>
    <ol>Utilize my expository skills, expanding and growing on them as well</ol>
    <ol>Program for fantasy purposes; possibly data extrapolation for takes</ol>
    <ol>Designing my own fantasy page</ol>
    <ol>Incorporate accessibility, such as for visually or hearing impaired</ol>
    <ol>Make a page as an illustration and outlet to make the world a better place</ol>
    <ol>Seeing how much I can do with CSS</ol>
    <ol>Designing beautiful color schemes. I just love that</ol>
    <ol>Finally, one of my childhood dreams: making my own game</ol>
    <ol>Undoubtedly, many, many more than I'm gonna fit on this list currently</ol>

    <h3><em>I know I have to go through the motions.</em>But if anyone happens to see this,
    just know that this journey will have me eventually change this world. 
    Even if this is all I have to start with right now. Thanks for reading.</h3>
